## Note on Issues

Please do not post issues here that are related to your own code when taking the course. Add those in the Udemy Q/A. If you clone THIS repo and there are issues, then you can submit

## Usage

### ES Modules in Node

We us ECMAScript Modules in the backend in this project. Be sure to have at least Node v14.6+ or you will need to add the "--experimental-modules" flag.

Also, when importing a file (not a package), be sure to add .js at the end or you will get a "module not found" error

You can also install and setup Babel if you would like

### Env Variables

Create a .env file in then root and add the following

```
NODE_ENV = development
PORT = 5000
MONGO_URI = your mongodb uri
JWT_SECRET = 'abc123'
```

### Install Dependencies (frontend & backend)

```
npm install (for server)
install-client (for client)
```

### Run

```
# Run frontend (:3000) & backend (:5000)
npm run dev

# Run backend only
npm run server
```

## Build & Deploy

```
# Create frontend prod build
cd frontend
npm run build
```

There is a Heroku postbuild script, so if you push to Heroku, no need to build manually for deployment to Heroku

### Seed Database

You can use the following commands to seed the database with some sample users and products as well as destroy all data

```
# Import data
npm run data:import

# Destroy data
npm run data:destroy
```

```
Sample User Logins

guru@example.com (Customer)
